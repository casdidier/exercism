# @exercism/eslint-config-typescript

This is the shared [`eslint`][web-eslint] configuration used by the [TypeScript track][git-typescript] (for students) and the files contributors and maintainers touch. [Shareable configs][web-shareable-configs] are designed to work with the `extends` feature of `.eslintrc` files. This means you can use the same configuration you're used to on [Exercism][web-exercism] in your on projects!

## Usage

To use the configuration for students, open your [eslint configuration][web-eslint-configuration] file, and add the following value to `extends`. For example, for JSON based configuration files:

```json
{
  "extends": "@exercism/eslint-config-typescript"
}
```

To use the configuration used by contributors and maintainers, add the following to `extends`:

```json
{
  "extends": "@exercism/eslint-config-typescript/maintainers"
}
```

## Students configuration

Find the student configuration [here](index.js). It's goal is to help detect and prevent common problems, without making _any_ decisions about code-style.

The rules are based on:

- [`eslint:recommended`][web-eslint-recommended]
- [`plugin:import`][git-eslint-plugin-import]
- A few extra rules that catch common issues but are not enabled via the recommended plugin. See [this PR][git-javascript-pr-1094] for a bit of discussion and rationale.
- Adding TypeScript _specific_ rules.

Because the [Exercism TypeScript track][git-typescript] is primarily focussing on running the exercises on Node, only `node` and `es2021` are turned on as environment, but when extending this configuration, you can add more (or turn those off).

## Maintainers configuration

Similar to the students configuration, and found [here](maintainers.js), it also includes the [`prettier` plugin][git-eslint-plugin-prettier] because we use [`prettier`][web-prettier] to achieve consistent code formatting. This plugin turns _off_ rules that conflict with formatting.

Additionally, it doesn't have warnings but errors for most/all of the rules in the students configuration.

## Tooling configuration

Because the tooling (such as the [TypeScript Analyzer][git-typescript-analyzer], [Representer][git-typescript-representer], and [Test Runner][git-typescript-test-runner]) are written in TypeScript, they don't use the same configuration files. If you're looking for those, or to build your own tools in TypeScript, go to [@exercism/eslint-config-tooling][git-eslint-config-tooling].
